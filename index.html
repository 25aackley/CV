<h3>Bio</h3>

<p>School Life: My school life is like a roller coaster because I have a lot of homework somedays and not a lot of others. I have Math, Computer Science, 3D Art, Geography on A days. I have Biology, Peer Tutor, Office Assistant Counseling, and English on B days. My favorite days are B days because I have a lot of free time to do my assignments and also to read.</p>
<p>Personal Life: My personal life is pretty boring to be honest, I live with my mom and my step-dad and my two younger siblings. When I am at home, I am either doing homework, cleaning, or I am reading a book. If I am not at my mom’s I am either at my dad’s or at my grandma’s, at my grandma’s I read and do homework and sometimes I bake. At my dad’s I am again reading, doing homework, watching my brothers play video games, or I am doing something outside with my dad and his girlfriend.</p>
